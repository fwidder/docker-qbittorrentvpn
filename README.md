# Access the WebUI
Access https://IPADDRESS:PORT from a browser on the same network. (for example: https://192.168.0.90:8280)

## Default Credentials
Default username is `admin`. Password is generated at first startup and can be found in the container logs. The password can be changed from the WebUI after logging in.

# How to use WireGuard 
The container will fail to boot if `VPN_ENABLED` is set and there is no valid .conf file present in the /config/wireguard directory. Drop a .conf file from your VPN provider into /config/wireguard and start the container again. The file must have the name `wg0.conf`, or it will fail to start.

## WireGuard IPv6 issues
If you use WireGuard and also have IPv6 enabled, it is necessary to add the IPv6 range to the `LAN_NETWORK` environment variable.  
Additionally the parameter `--sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0` also must be added to the `docker run` command, or to the "Extra Parameters" in Unraid.  
The full Unraid `Extra Parameters` would be: `--restart unless-stopped --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0"`  
If you do not do this, the container will keep on stopping with the error `RTNETLINK answers permission denied`.
Since I do not have IPv6, I am did not test.

# How to use OpenVPN
The container will fail to boot if `VPN_ENABLED` is set and there is no valid .ovpn file present in the /config/openvpn directory. Drop a .ovpn file from your VPN provider into /config/openvpn (if necessary with additional files like certificates) and start the container again. You may need to edit the ovpn configuration file to load your VPN credentials from a file by setting `auth-user-pass`.

**Note:** The script will use the first ovpn file it finds in the /config/openvpn directory. Adding multiple ovpn files will not start multiple VPN connections.

## Example auth-user-pass option for .ovpn files
`auth-user-pass credentials.conf`

## Example credentials.conf
```
username
password
```

## PUID/PGID
User ID (PUID) and Group ID (PGID) can be found by issuing the following command for the user you want to run the container as:

```
id <username>
```

# Issues
If you are having issues with this container please submit an issue on GitHub.  
Please provide logs, Docker version and other information that can simplify reproducing the issue.  
If possible, always use the most up to date version of Docker, you operating system, kernel and the container itself. Support is always a best-effort basis.
